# Webpack TypeScript SCSS Project

This project is a simple setup using **Webpack** for bundling resources with support for **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, and image handling. It leverages **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for a smooth development experience, allowing for live updates without needing to refresh the browser.

## Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Write your JavaScript with type safety, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors.
- **SCSS Styling**: Utilize SCSS for styling your application, making it easier to manage styles with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimize images during the build process.
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Enjoy instant feedback while developing, as HMR allows for live reloading of modules without a full page refresh.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize your code in a modular way with ES6 modules, making it easier to manage and maintain.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ALazarevic/webpack-project-jump-start.git
   cd webpack-project-jump-start
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:8080, and any changes to your files will automatically reload the page.
4. **Build for Production**: To create a production build, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command will generate an optimized build in the dist folder.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```bash
/project-root
├── /dist                # Output folder for production builds
├── /src                 # Source folder for the application
│   ├── /assets          # Place for images
│   ├── /components      # Place for application components
│   ├── /pages           # Place for templates
│   ├── /scss            # Place for styles
│   ├── index.ts         # Main TypeScript entry point
├── package.json         # Project metadata and dependencies
└── webpack.config.js    # Webpack configuration file
```

## Technologies Used

- **Webpack**: A module bundler for JavaScript applications that manages dependencies and optimizes assets.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing code quality and development efficiency.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features such as variables, nesting, and mixins, allowing for more organized styles.
- **HtmlWebpackPlugin**: A plugin that simplifies the creation of HTML files to serve your bundles, helping to manage HTML file generation automatically.
- **Image Webpack Loader**: A loader that optimizes images during the build process, ensuring better performance and reduced load times.

## Benefits

- **Improved Development Workflow**: Streamlines the process of building and deploying applications, making development more efficient.
- **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript reduces bugs in your code and improves collaboration among developers through better tooling support and IDE integration.
- **Modular Code**: Structuring your project with modules enhances readability and maintainability, allowing each component to be developed and tested independently.
- **Enhanced Styling**: SCSS enables more organized and scalable stylesheets, which is particularly beneficial for larger projects with complex designs.
- **Optimized Assets**: Built-in image optimization ensures your application loads faster, improving user experience.
- **Live Reloading**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) provides immediate feedback during development, making it easier to see the effects of code changes without disrupting your workflow.

## Conclusion

This Webpack TypeScript SCSS project serves as a solid foundation for developing modern web applications with a focus on maintainability, performance, and developer experience. Feel free to modify and expand upon this template to suit your project's needs.
